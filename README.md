# Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain Simulation
> Implements a simulation for the sharded pos ethereum 2.0.

## Spec
Built using: https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-vdf-randomness-beacon/3566

## Motivation

The Eth 2.0 Spec is very difficult to understand, even for experienced developers.

We decided to make it easier for the community to understand, by building a live simulation from the most recent ETH 2.0 Spec

This meant we basically bashed our heads against the wall until we understood how it worked.

This helps to get more people able to contribute to the scalability development.

Specifically, the simulation visually shows how the system:
1) Generates randomness in the beacon chain
2) Provides randomness to the rest of the system
3) This is used to choose the next block proposer both in the beacon chain and in the shard chains

## Application
Use this simulator to visually conceptualize the workings of Eth 2.0

## Instructions

Run simulation.py

## Unit Testing

Run testing.py
